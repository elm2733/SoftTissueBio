This repository includes everything I have built for my graduate research project. Each of the files uploaded is described in this README file. My goal is to analyze the mechanical properties of right ventricular myocardium under torsion.

Bridge: I designed a bridge to mount to a Z-Stage in SolidWorks. The rectangular opening provides a tight fit for a standard microscope slide.
        This is important so that the tissue can be properly imaged while undergoing a torsional load. I am interested in how the collagen fibers react to this
        deformation mode.
        
ExperimentNew: This is the SolidWorks Assembly of the Torsion Tester that I built. It consists of a Zaber X-RSW series rotation stage, two Futek load sensors, a ThorLabs Z-Stage, and the bridge I prototyped.
